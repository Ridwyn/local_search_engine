## Local Search (tf-idf)
Idea is to create a search index of documents including pdf, xml, html, and raw txt files found in a directory. To allow searching through documents given a word search.

Supply a directory which contains documents to be indexed.
Search through documents with a word or phrase to get list of related documents
